# Assembler-basics

In this repository you can find some **Assembler** simple programs implementation.

## Files description

### 1. HelloWorld
Just a program that prints message ***"Hello, World!"***

### 2. Expression
This program calculates the value of expression ``` c - (a + b) / 2 + d ```. Variables are constant.

### 3. ArrayActions
This program operates with predefined array and assigns to each array element (starting from the second)
the maximum of its predecessors and itself.

### 4. Strrchar
This is an implementation of **strrchar** function from **C**.
It finds the last occurrence of a character in string.

### 5. LongArith
This program can sum, multiply and subtract long positive numbers that don't fit into **uint**.
All operations are performed by "pencil-and-paper".

### 6. LongArith_hex
Similar to the previous program but operations are performed in hexadecimal notation.

### 7. LongArith_signed
This is an improvement of LongArith program - it works with signed numbers.
(subtraction isn't implemented cause it can be represented as addition of signed numbers)

### 8. MacroUsage
This program was created to demonstrate macro and ***include*** directive usage.
It deletes redundant spaces from input string and prints the result.
